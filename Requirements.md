## 3. Data Ingestion
- Multi-file upload for documents and images
  - Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, JPG, PNG
- YouTube video transcription (max 10-minute videos)
- Site.xml parser for web content
- Rich text editor for direct content input
  - Allow naming/labeling of text inputs

## 4. AI Processing
- Chatbot generation from ingested project data
- Embedding and indexing pipeline for uploaded data
- Project space UI:
  - Left sidebar with ingested data overview (read-only, file type icons)
  - Q&A functionality on ingested documents/data
- Bot interface:
  - Embeddable on external websites
  - Accessible via public URL

## 5. Context Management
- Context saving and retrieval for registered users
- Chatbot embedding for external websites:
  - Generate integration code snippets
  - Cross-platform compatibility (web and mobile)

## 6. Project Visualization
- Data source display within projects
- Multi-source ingestion visualization

## 7. Sharing and Integration
- Shareable project links generation
- Embed code provision for chatbot inclusion on external sites

## Technology Stack Refinement

### Backend
- FastAPI framework
- PostgreSQL database with vector data type support
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks

### Frontend
- Ionic framework with Capacitor for cross-platform support
- Implement asynchronous calls to backend API
- Use WebSockets for real-time updates where applicable

### API Design
- RESTful API design with JSON responses
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Use API versioning for future-proofing

### Security
- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data
- Use database indexing for faster queries
- Implement pagination for large data sets

### Deployment
- Containerize the application using Docker
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
